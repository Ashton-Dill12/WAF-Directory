# Web Application Firewall (WAF) Research | Arvest Bank

## Objective

This project aimed to evaluate Web Application Firewall (WAF) strategies to strengthen Arvest Bank’s web perimeter security. The primary focus was on identifying protection gaps related to OWASP Top 10 threats, performing research on best practices, and aligning implementation considerations with the bank’s existing environment and application ownership structure.

### Skills Learned

- Practical understanding of WAF functionality in enterprise networks  
- Mapping WAF protection to OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities  
- Conducting structured external research using security forums, standards, and industry best practices  
- Using the Configuration Management Database (CMDB) to trace protected assets and ownership  
- Creating a centralized directory of application owners for accountability and future integrations  

### Tools Used


- **OWASP Framework** – to guide evaluation of web application threats  
- **Configuration Management Database (CMDB)** – to identify application owners and associated infrastructure  
- **Microsoft Word & Excel** – for research notes, application mapping, and documentation  
- **Microsoft Teams** – for collaborative discussions and knowledge sharing  

## Steps

⚠️ *Note: Due to the sensitive nature of this project, no screenshots or internal documents are included.*

---

**Step 1: Identified Web Vulnerability Risks**  
Reviewed Nessus vulnerability scan summaries to understand current web exposure, with special attention to OWASP Top 10 threats.

---

**Step 2: Conducted External Research**  
Analyzed industry best practices and community-based insights on WAF rule tuning, false positives, and layered defense strategies.

---

**Step 3: Used CMDB to Map Protected Applications**  
Utilized the Configuration Management Database to identify the scope of WAF protection and link web applications to their responsible owners.

---

**Step 4: Built an Application Ownership Directory**  
Created a centralized directory listing each application, its business purpose, and the primary contact — enabling streamlined WAF policy decisions.

---

**Step 5: Compiled Recommendations**  
Outlined tactical steps to improve WAF effectiveness, application owner communication, and overall threat visibility — tailored to Arvest’s infrastructure.
